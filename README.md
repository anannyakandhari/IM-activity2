In this activity, I implemented the following Module 2 components:
-Abstraction: Created the abstract `Shape` class with abstract methods (`calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`).
-Inheritance: Defined subclasses (`Triangle` and `Rectangle`) that inherit from `Shape`.
-Polymorphism: Used method overriding so each shape calculates its own area and perimeter differently.
