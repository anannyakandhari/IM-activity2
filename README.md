This activity will help to reinforce learning of the Module 2 concepts of:

- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Package Initialization

## Additional Information

In this activity, I implemented the following Module 2 components:
abstraction: Created the abstract `Shape` class with abstract methods (`calculate_area` and `calculate_perimeter`).
Inheritance: Defined subclasses (`Triangle` and `Rectangle`) that inherit from `Shape`.
Polymorphism: Used method overriding so each shape calculates its own area and perimeter differently.
Package Initialization: Made it possible to import all shape classes at once using `from shape import *`.
Unit Testing: Wrote beginner-friendly tests for `Triangle` and `Rectangle` to verify functionality.
Client Program: Demonstrates creating shape objects, printing their details, and safely handling exceptions.
